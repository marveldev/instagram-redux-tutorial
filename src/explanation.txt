// install the redux and redux toolkit from the terminal.
// import the provider component from react-redux.
// The provider component is a property of redux that makes the redux store available
to the components inside it.

// the configureStore is a method property of RTK and expects a reducer object as its argument.
// we can have various objects in the reducer object, but only one configureStore.
// the reducer in the configureStore can take more than one object as its value
depending on th number of createSlice() store we have.

// the createSlice() expects an object as its argument.
// the object consist of nested objects with three key value: name, initialState, reducers.

// the name is the name of the slice, it is also gonna be used when calling the slice.
// initialState is the initial value of the state store, it also expects object.
// reducers is like the action house of the app, that modifies the state.
// reducers expect an object which consist of the actions that should be carried out, as related to that state.
// more than one action can be added to the reducers.

// the useDispatch() is imported from react-redux and is used to send data to the state,
through the dispatch()

// the useSelector() is a function that gets the data from the state.

// why redux toolkit not redux
// redux toolkit allows for lesser code importation and implementation.

// redux allows for better and more efficeient state management system
